# Capture The Flag (CTF) for Cryptography Exam at PoliTO
A Capture The Flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity competition where participants solve challenges to find hidden pieces of data called "flags". These flags prove youâ€™ve completed the challenge successfully and follows a specific format. For this CTF the flag format is CRYPTO24{example_flag}.

## C and OpenSSL Programming Challenges
Participants will face challenges requiring proficiency in C programming and OpenSSL. These tasks aim to assess knowledge in implementing cryptographic algorithms, secure coding practices, and understanding vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementations.

**OpenSSL** is a widely used open-source toolkit that provides robust implementations of cryptographic primitives. It supports a range of symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms, secure hashing functions, and digital signatures. 


- **`bytewise.c`** - Involves bitwise operations on encrypted data.
- **`changeDGST.c`** - Deals with modifying or computing message digests (hash functions).
- **`firstDecryption.c`** - A decryption challenge requiring understanding of symmetric ciphers.
- **`firstHMAC.c`** - Involves HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code) operations.
- **`guessAlgo.c`** - Requires identifying cryptographic algorithms based on given data.
- **`guessWhat.c`** - A guessing challenge related to cryptographic methods.
- **`keyedDigest.c`** - Related to keyed hash functions for data integrity.
- **`nameOfTheCipher.c`** - Requires determining the encryption scheme used.
- **`padding.c`** - Likely involves padding attacks or padding schemes in encryption.


## Python Attacks to Symmetric and Asymmetric Cryptography
Python is widely used for cryptanalysis and automation in cybersecurity. This section involves attacking or breaking cryptographic mechanisms using Python scripts.

#### **`crypto-asymmetric`**
- Challenges related to RSA, ECC, and other public-key cryptosystems.
- Include RSA factorization and weak key analysis.

#### **`crypto-symmetric`**
- Includes AES, DES, XOR-based encryption challenges.
- Involve brute-force attacks, key recovery, and padding oracle attacks.
